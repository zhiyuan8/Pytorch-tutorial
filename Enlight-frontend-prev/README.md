# Introduction
In this file, some frontend application, like the dashboard will be saved here. The application may include the *recommendation system*, the *AI content generation* etc. Each subsection below would be a folder of the repo. Each folder corresponds to a front-end application.

The `Dash plotly` packages used in this repo are listed below:
```bash
$ pip install dash
$ pip install dash_bootstrap_components
$ pip install plotly
```

Meanwhile, we may also consider to use `react.js` to build the front-end application. 



# Recommendation_system
In this folder, we create a dashboard for the use of the recommendation system. The dashboard is designed for Suntisfy currently.



# Dreambooth_app

# Enlightai-webpage
The react code for the landing page. Locate in the folder of `landing-page-service` and use `bash start_service.sh`. Note that we need to override the `config.js` file.
